Wiring:

Needed to connect to to 5V DC power source for example iPhone charger.
The button can be glued on to the top as seen in the picture. This button toggles the modes of the lamp.
The .ino file needs to be uploaded to an Arduino compatible board. Tutorials can be found on the internet. You need to adjust the PIXEL_COUNT variable in the .ino file to fit the number of LEDs on your strip. You also need to install the Adafruit_NeoPixel library. This can be done with the library manager in the Arduino IDE.
The soldered Arduino and wiring can be housed in the lamp. Solder skills required. Use shrinking tube to avoid short circuits.
